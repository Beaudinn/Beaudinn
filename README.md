### Hi nerds ðŸ‘‹

My name is Beaudinn Greve. You'll find me on Twitter at [@beaudinn](https://twitter.com/beaudinn). I'm a full-stack developer, entrepreneur, UI/UX enthusiast and bacon-lover. I live in the Netherlands near Amsterdam and I love PHP and awesome design. I am a big fan of Laravel, Limewire, VueJS, InertiaJS and TailwindCSS - in short the LIT stack from the early stage.
